## My process

### Built with

- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Webpack
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

I have struggled with the responsive design of this project, so I would like to keep researching about it.

### Useful resources

- [Separating responsibilities in your code](https://sairys.medium.com/react-separating-responsibilities-using-hooks-b9c90dbb3ab9) - This article was very useful to start structuring my project. Even thoug it is a very small in size project, deciding a proper component structure felt overwhelming when I started this challenge. It also offers you tips on how to make further research on the topic.
